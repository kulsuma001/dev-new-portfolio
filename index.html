            <p>Blood is a specialized connective tissue,composed of fluid portion of plasma and cellular
                elements,circulating
                through the cardiovascular system.
                bone can be defined as highly specialized connective tissue of the body.the two principle components of
                this
                material is chollagen,and calcium phosphate,distinguish bone from such other hard tissues such as
                chilin,enamel.
                cartilage is a strong flexible connective tissue,that protects your joints and bones.
                cartilage prevents friction and prevents them from rubbing together when you use your joints.</p>

            <p>This site is important for programming.this skill is very useful.
                with programming you can and analyze survey results,build tools for other people,create custom
                websites.write games,examine genetic data,connect people with each others and so on.if you would like a
                more gradual, video-based presentation to Python, you may want to examine Python from Scratch, offered
                by the University of Waterloo. There is also a video series on Language Independent Programming Lessons
                which can be a useful supplement.
